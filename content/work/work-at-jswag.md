**ISWAG’s** goal was to connect local communities and smaller businesses together. This post documents my learnings as an intern and early employee at the startup

## The Situation.

Connectivity is a huge problem in Nigeria and other developing countries. Lives and commercial opportunities are lost due to inefficient information sharing. iSWAG was founded to create an easier way for people to be in sync with their immediate commuunity.
