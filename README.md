## Customize Peacock
Peacock ships with 3 basic content types
- **Articles**: Long form content. Think blog posts 📚. All articles are in the `/content/articles` folder. Any markdown document you add here will show on the `/articles` page.
- **Notes**: Short form Spontaneous content 🖋. All notes are in the `/content/notes` folder. 
- **Works**: Case studies and projects you want to show 🛠. All works are in the `/content/works` folder. There's a `selectedWork` field in the markdown meta. Setting it to `true` will display the case study/work on the `index.tsx` page.
